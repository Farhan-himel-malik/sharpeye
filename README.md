## How It Works

SharpEye employs a multi-layered approach to detect threats:

1. **Data Collection**: It gathers data from various system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity.
2. **Analysis**: The collected data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that may indicate malicious activity.
3. **Alerts**: When a potential threat is detected, SharpEye generates alerts to notify the user.

This approach allows for both proactive and reactive security measures, ensuring your system remains secure.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for SharpEye.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Flask**: For creating the user interface.
- **SQLite**: For managing application data.
